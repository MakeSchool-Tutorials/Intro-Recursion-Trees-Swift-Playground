 # Fancy trees

 Now that you've conquered a basic tree, can you make it fancier?

 - callout(Copy your code): Grab the code you wrote for `drawTree` on the last page and copy it into the body of the `drawTree` function below!

 ## Modify to make a fancier tree

 We created a pretty basic looking tree in the last few exercises. Now that we have a fully recursive implementation, can you make it fancier?

 Before you get started, let's take a look at the functions you can use!

 ### Drop and lift the pen
 
 - callout(Drop the pen): `penDown()`
 
 
 - callout(Lift the pen): `penUp()`
 
 
 - note: The pen starts out down.
 
 ### Moving the pen
 
 - callout(Move by a number of steps): `move(steps: Int)`
 
 
 - callout(Move directly to coordinates): `moveTo(x: Int, y: Int)`
 
 
 - callout(Rotate heading by an angle): `rotate(degrees: Int)`
 
 ### Change the pen
 
 - callout(Set color of pen): `setColor(red: Double, green: Double, blue: Double)`
 
 
 - note: Each value should be between 0 and 1. eg. `setColor(red: 0.0, green: 0.0, blue: 0.0)` would change the pen to be black. `setColor(red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 0.0)` would change the pen to be red.
 
 
 - callout(Set thickness of pen): `set(thickness: Double)`

 ## Get started!

 - experiment: Let your imagination go wild and make something awesome!

 ## Inspiration

 Here are some ideas to try out...

 - Make branches thinner with each iteration (you may want to add additional parameters).
 - Decrease the angle in between branches with each iteration (you may want to add additional parameters).
 - Decrease the length of branches with each iteration (you may want to add additional parameters).
 - Add "leaves" to the tips of the tree (draw a leaf before your `return` call).
 - Introduce randomness! Real trees are not perfectly symettrical, why should yours be?
 - Change color between branches or for leaves.
